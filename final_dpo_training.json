The expected utility of Option A is:\n0.75 * (97500 + 71) + 0.25 * (97500 - 84)\n= 0.75 * (1 - e^(-975.71)) + 0.25 * (1 - e^(-974.16))\n≈ 0.75 * 0.6323 + 0.25 * 0.6321\n≈ 0.4742 + 0.1580\n≈ 0.6322\n\nFor Option B, the improbable outcome is receiving $71, and the probable outcome is receiving $9. Using the same probabilities as above, the expected utility of Option B is:\n0.25 * (97500 + 71) + 0.75 * (97500 + 9)\n= 0.25 * (1 - e^(-975.71)) + 0.75 * (1 - e^(-975.09))\n≈ 0.25 * 0.6323 + 0.75 * 0.6322\n≈ 0.1581 + 0.4742\n≈ 0.6323\n\nComparing the expected utilities, Option B (0.6323) has a slightly higher expected utility than Option A (0.6322). Therefore, I select Option B. 1"
